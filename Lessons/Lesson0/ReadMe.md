0. Setup Python & Tensorflow on Mac, Windows, and Windows-GPU
> In this lesson we will get setup to write code in Python and TF2, we will also run some existing code and do Q&A


# Create an environment and install Tensorflow 2

1. Create an environment to work in

# Troubleshooting

- If you try and run code, but do not have the correct packages installed, you will get an error such as:
